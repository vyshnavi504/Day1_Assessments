	<h1>NATURE</h1>
	The sight of the hills is a beauty<br>
	The bright moon is the sign of purity<br>
    The flow of the river is a murmuring music<br>
    The act of the sun is so philanthropic<br>
    The rain of theclouds is very refreshing<br>
    The blowing of the wind is so soothing<br>
    The roaring of the ocean has its own reaso<br>
    How charming is the changing of the season!<br>
